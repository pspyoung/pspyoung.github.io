				I am a Full Stack Developer with an MA in Sport Psychology. I studied
				Sport Psychology to learn how people perform at their best, and
				transferred those skills in Social Work to solve everyday problems.
				After three-years of reacting to similar crises, I wanted a more
				technically challenging career. Instead of applying band-aids, I wanted
				to proactively create meaningful solutions. That’s when I discovered and
				fell in love with coding. I enjoy the technical challenge, the immediate
				feedback of knowing when the code works, and creating tangible results.
				My code is similar to my work with people: looking at the application or
				person as a whole, with great attention to detail, and with the client’s
				best interest at heart.
